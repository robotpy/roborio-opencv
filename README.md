OpenCV wheel builder for RoboRIO
================================

Packages OpenCV in a wheel for installation on the RoboRIO.

Usage
=====

You can install this on your RoboRIO by installing the `robotpy-opencv` package
with `robotpy-installer` ([see the docs for details](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/robot.html)).

For detailed information about how to use OpenCV, see their [website](http://opencv.org/).
There's lots of documentation and tutorials/etc available.

The image processing section of the Programmer's Guide at the [RobotPy documentation site](http://robotpy.readthedocs.io)
also has some details for using OpenCV on a RoboRIO.
